Pjoject: Dhaka Hourly Air Quality Detection
//
This is a machine learning based project of detecting the air quality of Dhaka city. We know  air quality monitoring is a critical concern in densely populated urban areas like Dhaka, Bangladesh, where air
pollution poses significant health and environmental challenges. This study examines an air quality dataset through data preparation and a variety of machine learning models for prediction.
Preprocessing operations are carried out on the dataset, including managing missing values, encoding category characteristics, and standardizing numerical features. 
//
We train and test three distinct regression models: 
1. Decision Tree, 
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and
3. Linear Regression. 
//
Performance of the models is contrasted between before and after hyperparameter adjustment. Insights regarding feature scaling, model training, testing, comparison, and selection are provided in the study.
